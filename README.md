# Privacy Checklist

This is a general list of stuff you can use to increase your privacy based on
ease of use. You don't have to do everything on this list, but try to do at
least the easy stuff. Pull requests welcome!

* *Easy* - Easy setup and no maintenance
* *Medium* - Requires reading to setup and maintain
* *Hard* - Must understand how the underlying system works (lots of gotchas)

## Web Browsing
* Easy
    * [ ] Use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Brave](https://brave.com/) - Open source browsers and frequent security updates
    * [ ] HTTPS extension ([HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/Https-everywhere)) - use encrypted connections whenever possible
    * [ ] Use a password manager ([KeePass](http://keepass.info/), [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/), [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/), [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword), etc.) - Always use generated passwords for websites and save those in a password manager! Also, use [diceware](https://www.dmuth.org/diceware/) to generate a password.
    * [ ] Anti-tracking extension ([Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger), [uBlock](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation), etc.) - many tracking and malware attacks are distributed by ads and analytics trackers
    * [ ] Disable third party cookies ([Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/disable-third-party-cookies), [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en)) - prevents embedded content from setting tracking cookies
    * [ ] [Disable Flash] (https://helpdeskgeek.com/how-to/disable-adobe-flash-on-your-pc-why-you-would-want-to/)
    * [ ] Enable Two-Factor-Authentication (2FA) ([tutorial](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-enable-two-factor-authentication)) - enable 2FA on logins for every service that supports it!
* Medium
    * [ ] OpenVPN ([Windows](https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/downloads.html), [Mac](https://tunnelblick.net/), [Linux](https://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/459675:configure-linux-clients-to-connect-to-openvpn-server)) - paid, faster obfuscation of browsing ([list of VPNs](https://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-services-keep-you-anonymous-in-2019/))
    * [ ] [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en) - free, slower, safer obfuscation of browsing
* Hard
    * [ ] Reduce fingerprints ([tool](https://panopticlick.eff.org/)) - really hard to totally eliminate brower fingerprints

## Email
* Easy
    * [ProtonMail] (https://protonmail.com/) - Secure Email/VPN/Calendar based in Switzerland
* Medium
    * None (private email is hard)
* Hard

* Medium
    * [ ] [trezorit](https://tresorit.com/) - [Swiss privacy laws](https://tresorit.com/security)
    * [ ] Encrypted cloud backups ([SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/)) - paid and proprietary, but easier than running your own server
